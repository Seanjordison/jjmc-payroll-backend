## Architecture

```
Frontend (React/Ionic)
        │
        │  Firebase SDK — real-time listeners, auth, storage
        │
        ├──▶  Firebase Firestore  ◀──── this backend
        │
        └──▶  this backend (REST API)
                    │  Firebase Admin SDK
                    └──▶  Firestore / Firebase Auth
```

The backend uses **Firebase Admin SDK** to read and write Firestore data with full privileges, and to verify the Firebase ID tokens that the frontend sends in every request.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Node.js | ≥ 18 |
| npm | ≥ 9 |
| A Firebase project | (same one as the frontend) |
| Firebase service account key | (downloaded from Firebase Console) |

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/jjmc-payroll-backend.git
cd jjmc-payroll-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Download the Firebase Service Account key

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) → your project
2. Project Settings → Service Accounts → **Generate new private key**
3. Save the downloaded JSON as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root

> ⚠️ **Never commit `serviceAccountKey.json` to Git.** It is in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Create the `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

### 5. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev   # development (auto-reload with nodemon)
npm start     # production
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000/api/health` to confirm it is running.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | No | Port to listen on (default: `5000`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `development` or `production` |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` | Yes* | Path to service account JSON, e.g. `./serviceAccountKey.json` |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` | Yes* | Base64-encoded service account JSON (alternative to path) |
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Yes | e.g. `database-test-34eff` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | No | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins |

\* Provide **one** of `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` or `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64`.

---

## Running the Server

```bash
# Development (nodemon hot-reload)
npm run dev

# Production
npm start

# Assign a role to a user (CLI)
npm run set-role -- <UID> <role>
# Example:
npm run set-role -- abc123 bookkeeper
```

---

## API Reference

All endpoints require a valid **Firebase ID token** in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <idToken>
```

Obtain the token from the Firebase Auth SDK (`user.getIdToken()`).

---

## Role System

| Role | Firestore value | Access level |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Admin | `admin` | Full access, approval workflows |
| Bookkeeper | `bookkeeper` | Own clients, create/submit drafts, reply to inquiries |
| Client Staff | `client-staff` | View own data, ask inquiries, view tutorials |

The role is read from the `users` Firestore collection on every request, so role changes take effect immediately without requiring a token refresh.

---

## Philippine Payroll Calculations

The backend mirrors the frontend `payrollCalculations.js` exactly:

| Deduction | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **SSS** | Bracketed table (₱180 floor at <₱4,250 gross, ₱1,350 cap at ≥₱29,750) |
| **PhilHealth** | 5% of gross, floored at ₱500, capped at ₱5,000 |
| **Pag-IBIG (HDMF)** | Fixed ₱200 |
| **BIR (TRAIN Law)** | Progressive monthly brackets (0% ≤ ₱20,833 … 35% > ₱666,667) |

---

## Scripts

```bash
# Set a user role directly in Firestore
npm run set-role -- <UID> <role>

# Example — make a user a bookkeeper
npm run set-role -- r4nd0mUidHere bookkeeper
```

---

## Deployment

### Railway / Render / Fly.io

1. Set environment variables in your hosting dashboard.
2. For `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64`, generate it locally:
   ```bash
   base64 -i serviceAccountKey.json | tr -d '\n'
   ```
   Then paste the output as the env var value.
3. Set `NODE_ENV=production`.
4. The start command is `npm start`.

### Google Cloud Run

The app is stateless and works perfectly on Cloud Run.  
When deployed to GCP, you can omit the service account env vars entirely and use **Application Default Credentials** instead.
